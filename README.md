## Description
The International Space Station (ISS) circles the earth in roughly 92 minutes and
completes 15.5 orbits per day. The ISS orbits are fixed, and only a few 
geographical locations are flown over. A precise and live map of its current
position and weather conditions around are required, if one desires to take 
a look at this marvelous craft of engineering with a telescope.

The Helios web-service aims to solve this problem. By collection data from 
various sources and APIs, such as from NASA and ZAMG, processing the information,
and then displaying a live map representation.

Our main goal is to answer the simple question of: where do I need to stand to 
have a clear view onto the ISS.

## Functionalities

- Map shown on Web page
- NASA API for ISS location integrated into Map
- ZAMG API for weather integrated into Map
- (optional) Forecast
