## Description
The International Space Station (ISS) circles the earth in roughly 92 minutes and
completes 15.5 orbits per day. The ISS orbits are fixed, and only a few
geographical locations are flown over. A precise live map of the station's current
position above earth, and the weather conditions around that point, are required
if one wants to take a look at it.

The Helios web-service aims to solve this problem. It does so by collection data
from various sources and APIs, such as from NASA and ZAMG, processing the
information, and then displaying a live map representation.

Our main goal is to answer the simple question of: where do I need to stand and
at what time to have a clear view onto the ISS with my telescope?

## Functionalities

- Map shown on Web page
